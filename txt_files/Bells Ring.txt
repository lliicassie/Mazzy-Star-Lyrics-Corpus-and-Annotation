Bells ring into the night
Like a mystery
Sounding at night
Hold your throat
And arm together

And see the light that goes away
Leave my heart down by the water
He spins inside my soul
It isn't true but you follow
Just hold me down by the water

They say you look like
I'm gonna leave her
Look up to see the weakness
In the sky
Nobody's eyes are bright and starry
Nobody wants to know your reason why

Hold your hands out towards the water
In front of me to know I'm with you
Don't put it all into your hero
Look on if you believe
Look on if you believe

Don't want to say that I'm through with it
Just want to be
Right by your side
Right by your side
