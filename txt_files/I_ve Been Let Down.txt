I've been let down
And I'm still coming round
I've been pulled down
And I'm still coming round for you
Coming round for you

Take away everything that feels fine
Catch a shape in the circles of my mind
Make me feel like I belong to you
Make me feel it even if it ain't true

Catch a train on a silver afternoon
A thousand miles and I'm gettin' there too soon
Take me there, when I should be going home
Tell me why I'm still feeling (all) alone

I've been let down
And I'm still coming round
I've been pulled down
And I'm still coming round for you
Coming round for you
