so that's what you need
Picking up all the things that you see
You should make sure you found
Everything that's clear this time
Get on from the bus
On the way from your shoulder has passed
These things can dry


You know things always someone
That you betray never mind pieces found
You pick all the plans and you go
Never could know when which way to show
And you left me behind
And you left them behind


You came now rest fall away
With all the things the con has come your way
Look across where all everythings you know
Show them a few  that's the way you know
That's the way
That's the way you know


Get it from
fast asleep
Let it be, that is
The prize that you keep
