Tell your honey
Living all alone
I guess i'll always be
I guess i fear
Go and tell your honey
Can help from what i've seen
I don't feel true
Do you anyway
I can see you sometimes
And then i just don't care
She loves me
She loves me
I don't think i could ever see
Tell me that you're near
So free that i'm leaving you behind
Don't plan to let you say you're sorry
Indeed so
Or maybe you'll be high
Be high X3
Shiver in a bath
I feel nice
And see the light
