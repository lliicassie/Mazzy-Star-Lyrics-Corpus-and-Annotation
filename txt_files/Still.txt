I thought of you all of the time, love
And then I knew that you were mine
I see your house has gone away
And all the things in solitude
I just wanted to know your name
It wasn't like your faded smile

Your eyes are warm still
But inside you've just escaped
So let me turn around too
And turn your faded self away

All of the things inside you fade
I see your house and you know me

Smile
I thought of you on awakening
