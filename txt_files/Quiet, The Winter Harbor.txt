Well you're still walking
Around the block
You had a long time
To think who you are

You look so sad
Well, so you think
You say, "Come over"
And you're still a star

You're like a villain
In some old film
Walking in the dark
In somebody's room

Save me
'Cause I'm still sinking
We've got a harbor
Close to the shore

Simple
Your thoughts are swimming
I'd like to see them
When you're alone

You've got the same smile
You had before
It's just later
Than what I adore

Save me
'Cause I'm still sinking
We've got a harbor
Close to the shore
