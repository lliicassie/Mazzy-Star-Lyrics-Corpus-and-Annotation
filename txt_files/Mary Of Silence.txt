Oh Mary of silence
You pick my heart with a smile
Oh sweet Mary
Come inside for a while
Help me get a hold on you
Or I will
I thought of myself beside you
Take me into your skin

Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sweet Mary of silence

We have a steady confusion
You're looking at fear
It doesn't seem like the first time
You walked out in a hurry

I look in
In your window
To check my head in your pane
My last thoughts
They come to me
I can't take the pain

Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sweet Mary of silence

Help me walk with you
To the sky inï¿½?
Shuddering in myself...myself

Oh where
Oh where
Oh where

Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
