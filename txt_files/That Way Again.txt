He says that he tries to solve all his problems as he's bringing me down
I just wait all around
Forgiveness is an empty thought
I find myself moving on, moving on

He looks to my eyes once more
And gives me away like somebody's bride

I'm never going to think of him that way again
Never going to think of him that way again

He looks through and disappears
And I wonder if I'm still ashamed
I thought about it through and through
And it's just still the same

I'm never going to think of him that way again
Never going to think of him that way again
That way again
