After I stuck my hands
Into your ground
And pulled out somebody else's son

I felt a little unfortunate
A little mistake

I felt like I'd been wasted
All day long
All day long
After I bent myself to my knees
And raised my hands up
Right above my head
I felt a little
A little bright patch

I felt like I'd been wasted
All day long
All day long

After I took my eyes
From the west
And brought myself back
To my place
I felt a little light for a while
A little light stone

I felt like I'd been wasted
All day long
All day long
