Come up crash with the muses
Fells dust into ash
Come so close that I might see
The light inside me I might see

Let me hold you tight and arms
Tight and arms you lost your chance
Come so close that I might see
The crash of light come down on me

With good luck I'll find
The dark stop me now
Find me to your heart
Let me hold you tight
Like rain and sunshine on a rainy day
See the lights

Come so close that I might see
See the light come down on me
Searching like the fresh goes by small
Like wind refuse to die

Free me now so I can see
The taste of wind who lock me
Does the wind indeed like me
Does the wind indeed like me

With good luck I find the dark stop me now
Find me to your heart
Let me hold you tight
Like rain and sunshine on a rainy day

Let me hold you tight and arms
Tight and arms you lost your chance
Come so close that I might see
The crash of light come down on me
The crash of light come down on me
The crash of light come down on me

Let me hold you tight and arms
Tight and arms you lost your chance
Come so close that I might see
The crash of light come down on me

With spin luck I'll find the dark
Stop me now find me to your heart
The crash of light come down on me
So tonight the crash goes by

Small like wind and refuse to die
The crash of light come down on me
Come so close that I might see
See the light come down on me

I hold you tight like rain
Sunshine on a rainy day
Sunshine on a rainy day
