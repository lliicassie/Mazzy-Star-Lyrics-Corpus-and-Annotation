Just like that, she follows me
My wings are under her tree
She says one thing and that's just enough
It doesn't matter how much

Would I forget
Laying myself down
Just to regret
And that's all
Would I forget

I'll go away
I'll never know how far, how long
She keeps a diamond inside her door
She don't have a clue

Would I forget
Laying myself down
Just to regret
And that's all

Would I forget
Laying myself down
Just to regret
And that's all

And that's all
And that's all
