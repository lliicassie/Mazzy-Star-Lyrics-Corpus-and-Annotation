Everyday you can see
Changes in her hair and smile
I can wait a million days
While her smile goes away

Sometimes I feel deceived
By the slices in her hand
Secrets in her lipstick mouth
Shining on again
Shining on again

Capture a smile and then that's all
You won't know her so it's ok
Funny how things change
Funny how things change
