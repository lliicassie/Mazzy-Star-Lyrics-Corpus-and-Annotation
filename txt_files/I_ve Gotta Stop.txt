I've gotta stop
Making you stay
I've gotta know
You'd never say
Those words are meant
Not to be thrown
God hears you say
You put me on
But when you're weakened in my arms
Shining

You look so strange
From someone's window
You've got that ray
Like Palm Shore ray
But something's wrong
I'm sure you know
You seem to say
You'll never go
But when you're weary in my arms
Shining

I've gotta stop
Making you stay
I've gotta know
You'll never say
I've got that thought
To pass the time
God hears you say
That would be fine
But when I'm weary in your arms
Shining
