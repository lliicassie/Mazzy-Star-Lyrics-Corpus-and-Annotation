Behind my life is different colours
They go away and come back to you
It's just nowhere it can be found
It's just with me, come on, take it

Come on, there's no question of why

It's in between on the darkened hearts
Behind the unknown, that there's no chance
He has his hand among my swan
Keep it there, now that you've gone

Come on, there's no question of why
There's no question of why, no�[?]

And so I felt my eyes long�[?]

The touch of your hand it speaks of distance
In your heart
Behind my life I know
