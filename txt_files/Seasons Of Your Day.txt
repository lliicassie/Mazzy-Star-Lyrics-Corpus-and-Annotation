Won't you let me come inside?
I've released all of my pride
I know you're alone because I've been there
I was storming all of the day outside your door
It's a misery that the rivers will never stream me back before
I know you've been missing me
Well you know, I've been missing you too
And miles away, let me know your reason
It's my mistake not to understand the seasons of your day that you change

Won't you let me come inside?
I've released all of my pride
And I know you're alone because I've been there
I know you've been missing me
Well you know, I've been missing you too
